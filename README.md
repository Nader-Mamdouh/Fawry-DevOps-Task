## **üìú Task 1: Custom grep Command (mygrep.sh)**
A bash script that mimics the basic functionality of the grep command, supporting:
Case-insensitive search for a string within a file
Options:
1) -n ‚Üí Show line numbers for matches
2) -v ‚Üí Invert match (show lines that do not contain the string)
3) Support for combined options like -vn, -nv
4) Error handling for missing arguments, missing files, etc.
5) Bonus: Help menu (--help) and improved option parsing using getopts.
6) Validation: Tested using a sample testfile.txt and verified with multiple command examples.

## **üåê Task 2: Troubleshooting Internal Web Dashboard Connectivity**
A structured troubleshooting guide to diagnose and fix an internal service (internal.example.com) that became unreachable.

1) DNS resolution comparison using /etc/resolv.conf and Google's 8.8.8.8
2) Service reachability checks on HTTP/HTTPS ports using tools like curl, telnet, ss, and netstat
3) Listing all potential causes (DNS misconfiguration, network issues, service down, firewall, etc.)
4) Proposing and applying fixes with clear Linux commands
5) Screenshots documenting the troubleshooting process
6) Bonus: Manual DNS override via /etc/hosts and persisting DNS settings with systemd-resolved or NetworkManager.


## **üöÄ Skills Demonstrated**
1) Bash scripting and Linux CLI tools
2) DNS and network troubleshooting
3) Shell script argument parsing (getopts)
4) System debugging and service recovery
5) Good documentation and structured reporting
